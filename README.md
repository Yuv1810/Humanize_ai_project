# Project Name

## Description

This project is a web application built with a Next.js frontend and an Express.js backend. It leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and React components, combined with the simplicity and robustness of Express.js for handling backend logic and API endpoints.

## Features

- **Next.js Frontend**: Fast, server-side rendered React components.
- **Express Backend**: Robust and flexible backend logic.
- **API Endpoints**: Well-structured RESTful APIs.
- **Hot Reloading**: Development servers with hot reloading for both frontend and backend.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 12.0.0)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
    cd yourproject
    ```

2. **Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

### Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Start the Next.js development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Start the Express server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Running Both Frontend and Backend Concurrently

To run both the frontend and backend concurrently, you can use a tool like `concurrently`:

1. Navigate to the root of the project:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

2. Install `concurrently` globally if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    npm install -g concurrently
    ```

3. Add the following script to your root `package.json`:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "start": "concurrently \"npm run dev --prefix frontend\" \"npm start --prefix backend\""
    }
    ```

4. Run both servers:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
